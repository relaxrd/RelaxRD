# RelaxRD

This repository contains the reference implementation for the paper  
"Storage-Centric Relation Design via High-Quality Approximate Functional Dependencies".

RelaxRD studies how to design relational schemas guided by approximate functional dependencies (AFDs) in order to reduce storage redundancy while guaranteeing lossless reconstruction.



## Dataset

We include a **representative dataset (fraud)** as a running example throughout all three steps of RelaxRD:

- Approximate Functional Dependency (AFD) discovery  
- Core AFD set selection  
- RelaxRD schema construction and relation instantiation 

Due to its size, the dataset is not included in this repository.  
Readers can download the file **fraudTrain.csv** from  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection  
and place it at: **dataset/fraud/fraudTrain.csv** 

Users may also replace this dataset with their own data by modifying the dataset paths accordingly.

For convenience and reproducibility, **the outputs produced on the fraud dataset are already included** in the corresponding `output/` directories for each step.  
These outputs allow readers to inspect intermediate and final results without rerunning the entire pipeline.

## Step 1: AFD Discovery

In this step, we obtain a pool of candidate approximate functional dependencies (AFDs).
AFDs can be provided by domain experts or discovered automatically.
In our implementation, we use the classical TANE-based algorithm to discover AFDs.


From the project root directory, run:

```bash
python -m AFD_discovery.main_tane \
  --data_dir dataset/fraud/fraudTrain.csv \
  --output_dir AFD_discovery/Sigma \
  --error 0.05
```

	--data_dir: path to the input CSV dataset
	--output_dir: directory to store discovered AFDs
	--error: error threshold ε for approximate FDs


The discovered AFDs are stored as a pickle file in **AFD_discovery/Sigma/fraudTrain_sigma.pkl**.


## Step 2: Core AFD Set Selection


Given a pool of candidate AFDs $\Sigma$, We provide two algorithms for selecting the core AFD set: **NaiveCore** and **QuickCore**.

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
python -m CoreAFD.main_coreafd \
  --data_dir dataset/fraud/fraudTrain.csv \
  --Sigma AFD_discovery/Sigma/fraudtrain.pkl \
  --method quickcore
```

	--data_dir: path to the input dataset.
	--Sigma: path to the discovered AFD file produced in Step 1.
	--method: Core AFD selection algorithm: quickcore or naivecore.

The resulting core AFD set will be stored in **/CoreAFD/output/fraudTrain_coreafd.pkl**


## Step 3: RelaxRD Schema Construction and Relation Instantiation

Given an input dataset and a selected core AFD set, RelaxRD constructs a relaxed logical schema
and materializes the relation accordingly.


From the project root directory, run:


```bash
python -m RelaxRD.main_relaxrd \
  --data_dir dataset/fraud/fraudTrain.csv \
  --coreafd CoreAFD/output/fraudTrain_coreafd.pkl \
  --output_dir RelaxRD/output
```

	--data_dir: path to the input dataset
	--coreafd: path to the selected core AFD set
	--output_dir: root directory for storing decomposed relations

The decomposed relations will be stored in **RelaxRD/output/fraudTrain/**



## Step 4: Workload for quey latency



The Query_Performance/Workload/ directory contains the SQL workloads used for query latency evaluation.
For each dataset, two SQL files are provided:


	*.sql: the workload executed on the original large relation
	*_coreafd.sql: the corresponding workload rewritten for RelaxRD




The rewritten workload can be generated automatically using:


```bash
python Query_Performance/rewriter_tool.py
```

This tool converts queries over the original table into equivalent queries over the RelaxRD decomposition, enabling latency comparison between the original schema and the RelaxRD schema.


To evaluate latency on the RelaxRD schema, you must first load the decomposed relations (i.e., the RelaxRD output tables) into your database system.
These relations are located under:

	relaxrd/out/<dataset_name>/

In other words:

	1. use the original large table to run *.sql

	2. use the RelaxRD decomposed tables under relaxrd/out/<dataset_name>/ to run *_coreafd.sql



This allows fair workload-based latency evaluation between the original and RelaxRD storage layouts.
